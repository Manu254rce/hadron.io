                  or test out that awesome shiny new framework... Or integrate <br/>
                  your newly created stack. Maybe you just want a seamless ride from development to deploying <br />
                  your production build. Well, Hadron is actually built upon frameworks or libraries<br /> 
                  designed for speed. Meanwhile, get to experience firsthand the power of AI-powered code completion,<br />
